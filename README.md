# WordMetaData 
## An R Shiny app to retrieve metadata from word documents.

This project was created with the goal of accurately tracking the amount of time spent working on a single document, or on all documents within a directory.

To use this, you may need to edit server.R to search the correct "home" directory for your machine.
